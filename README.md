# 💤 Exploratory Data Analysis on Lucid Dreaming & Lifestyle Indicators

This project explores how various lifestyle habits—like sleep, physical activity, substance use, and mindfulness—relate to the frequency of lucid dreaming.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze synthetic survey-style data and uncover possible patterns in:
- Sleep duration
- Physical activity
- Meditation and dream journaling
- Caffeine, alcohol, and marijuana use

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name**: `lucid_dreaming_lifestyle.csv`
- **Source**: Synthetic (generated using Python)
- **Size**: 200 entries, 15 columns
- **Target**: `lucid_dream_freq` (none, monthly, weekly, nightly)

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook (hosted in GitHub Codespaces)
- GitHub for version control & documentation

---

## 📈 Key Insights

### 💤 Sleep & Activity
- Lucid dreamers commonly get **7+ hours of sleep** and **60–90 mins of daily activity**.
- However, these ranges also appear in non-lucid dreamers, suggesting more factors are at play.
- Sleep consistency (tight spread) may matter more than total hours.

### 🍷🌿 Substance Use
- Higher frequencies of **marijuana and alcohol use** appear slightly more in non-lucid dreamers.
- **Nightly lucid dreamers** lean toward **less frequent marijuana use**.
- **Rare/occasional substance use** may support better dream clarity.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Add real-world survey data (future goal)
- Build a logistic regression model to predict lucid dreaming
- Explore wearable sleep tracker integration
